# the official repository for the cx compiler
(please use `.cx` extension when writing c code that can only be compiled by cxc)

cxc compiles c99, but supports new features as well.

several new ideas introduced are inherited from more mature languages, such as the circle lang, zig and some my old private compiler project.
